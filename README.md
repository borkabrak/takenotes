Take Notes
==========

A note-taking app using jQuery.

Here's a [demo](http://borkabrak.org/takenotes)

Privacy
-------
Note data is stored locally on your computer, in a manner similar to cookies,
and is never transmitted anywhere.  Anyone not using your computer, including
myself, has zero way of seeing what you put in your notes.

TODO:
=====

* Replace undo button with a stack of recoverable notes, sized down, in the
  top right corner of the board.

* Some way to categorize them

    -color?

    -container boxes/file folders?

* Change fonts

* When re-focusing a note, place cursor at end of text

TO MAYBE DO:
============

* Note() object?

* Style notes to look more like scraps of notebook paper or post-its?
