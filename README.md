Take Notes
==========

A note-taking app using jQuery.

Here's a [demo](http://borkabrak.org/takenotes)

TODO:
=====

* Undo removing notes

* Style notes to look more like scraps of notebook paper or post-its.

* When re-focusing a note, place cursor at end of text

* Delete button for a more obvious way to remove notes?
    - and maybe a color picker with it to change the note color

* Note() object?

* Adjust board height to window
