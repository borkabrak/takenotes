* STACKS!  This is a very natural way to group these things that look like
    note cards.  Each note in a stack:
      -- shares an identical/similar color
      -- can be grouped into a visual stack when collapsed.
      -- When expanded, the color can indicate the relationship.  (Or visual
      lines connecting them, for colorblind accessibility)

* Allow changing fonts

* When re-focusing a note, place cursor at end of text

* Preserve newlines within notes over save/load

TO MAYBE DO:
============

* Style notes to look more like scraps of notebook paper or post-its?

* Change notes from div to textarea?

* See how much jQuery I can factor out?
