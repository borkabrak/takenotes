FEATURES

* STACKS!  This is a very natural way to group these things that look like
    note cards.  Each note in a stack:
      -- shares an identical/similar color
      -- can be grouped into a visual stack when collapsed.
      -- When expanded, the color can indicate the relationship.  (Or visual
      lines connecting them, for colorblind accessibility)
      -- The undo stack can be a regular stack, sized down and in a corner or
      something.

* Allow changing fonts

* When re-focusing a note, place cursor at end of text[1]

* Preserve newlines within notes over save/load

* Revamp undo button look-and-feel


A DIFFERENT WAY TO GROUP NOTES
==============================
Maybe have all the notes on a page at once comprise a single group.  A
drop-down or something can bear the name, which is editable.  This would allow
working with just the notes in a group, and easily switching between groups.


TO MAYBE DO:
============

* Style notes to look more like scraps of notebook paper or post-its?

* [1]Change notes from div to textarea?

* See how much jQuery I can factor out?
